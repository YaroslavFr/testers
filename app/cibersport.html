                                this year with Heroic reaching new heights on the back of a stunning campaign in August.

                            </h2>
                            <img src="img/article-7.png" alt="">
                            <p>If there is one thing 2020 will be known for in the grand scheme of things other than how
                                the global
                                situation changed the face of the scene, it will most likely be the popularity of
                                extended rosters.
                                Several teams attempted to create six-man lineups, but none were nearly as successful as
                                Vitality,
                                who might not have been the first to jump at the opportunity but were undoubtedly the
                                most effective
                                with Nabil "⁠Nivera⁠" Benrlitom.
                            </p>

                            <p>The French side was the first to test mid-series player swaps, with Nivera consistently
                                slotting in
                                for Richard "⁠shox⁠" Papillon on Inferno and for Kévin "⁠misutaaa⁠" Rabier on Dust2. It
                                was an
                                instant success on the former map at least, where Vitality went on a nine-map winning
                                streak on the
                                back of inspired play from the Belgian youngster on the AWP.
                            </p>

                            <p>Two teams soon followed Vitality's example after seeing the fruits of the Frenchmen's
                                unique
                                approach. At the end of the year, Astralis started to utilize Lucas "⁠Bubzkji⁠" Andersen
                                on Nuke
                                instead of Xyp9x, and Natus Vincere tried out Valeriy "⁠b1t⁠" Vakhovskiy in Egor
                                "⁠flamie⁠"
                                Vasilyev's place on Inferno at the end of the season, with varying degrees of success.
